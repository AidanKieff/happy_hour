design an app to host somewhere that will allow HCM happy hour to be easier to do.

- main page should allow you to add names to a vector list.
- main page should have option to continue to add names or run selection
- main page should allow you to add names to a seperate list of previous hosts
- selection should compare list and previous list names and randomly select a new host not in previous list
- app should email the new host somewhere
- optionally section for past previous host or ability to weight choices by how many times they've been previously selected? 


- will want to find hosting site that is hopefully free
- learn how to encrypt inputs
- potentially rust framework 
- rust email package to email new host
